Project Description:
Application that can be used to sign up for group cycling rides in various locations. User must log in to rsvp, but they are allowed to remain anonymous on the event page report.

Motivations:
I enjoy group cycling, and have moved around enough to realize that there is no centralized repository of public group rides (or at least I have never used one). This app is a basic representaion of what that might look like.
